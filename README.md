# SQL-Election-Analysis
This is an Unguided Data Analysis Project Work as part of Codebasics Resume Challenge 11,
 to showcase various skills which are very frequently used in data analysis processes. Dataset used in this project has been taken from Challenge documents itself. Apart from this some specific data like SGDP and Literacy Ratio for further analysis are taken from Internet. I have used Excel, SQL, PowerPoint and Web-Searches for different purposes throughout this project.
I believe my work will provide AtliQ Media with unique and sufficient content on Indian Elections of 2014 & 2019 as context for there show on Lok Sabha Elections of 2024.
